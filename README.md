# reminder
lo-tech phone reminder application which has come about from the joining of 2 projects which came together at an NHS Hackday event. A need was identified to assist patients and carers ensure medications are taken in an appropriate fashion that enables optium benefit to be derived from the medication

## What is it?
Patients, carers or friends can enable a reminder to be set via a phone message advising the patient it is time to take their medication. Medication reminder applications are readily available for smartphones, however many patients, especially in vulnerable groups do not have or are unable to use a smartphone. They usually have a standard telephone though, so our application calls patients with a recorded reminder message
